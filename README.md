# [PortfolioWebsite](https://itsmikestang.web.app/) deployed with firebase hosting

Say hello to my little friend! this portfolio website has been a must have for awhile now. I wanted to develop one for years, but my skillset wasn't quite up for the task, and I finally did! There are a few secrets around the website as well (hint: hover affects).

(check out my [blog](https://itsmikestang.web.app/blogpage.html) as well, it's linked here, as a project, and at the bottom of my website 😁)

This project is a forever WIP, so I will be updating it on github (or maybe switch to [replit](https://replit.com/@MikeStang) for an easier way of hosting and tracking sites) every once and awhile so my code is trackable.

Here's a shot of the page on load in, and yes, I added a CSS snowing affect for the holidays:
